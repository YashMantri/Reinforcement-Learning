# Reinforcement-Learning

1) Implementing Markov Decision Process (MDP) and developing a Reinforcement Learning environment.
   Also, implementing Q-learning on deterministic and stochastic environments.

2) Implementing Value Function Approximation algorithms - DQN and Double DQN on Open AI gym environments: CartPole-v0 and CartPole-v1

3) Implementing Policy Gradient algorithm - Actor critic on OpenAI gym environment
